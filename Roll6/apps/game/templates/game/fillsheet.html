            You can pick three of these effective weapons:

            You can pick one of these divine weapons:

            You can pick three of these monster-slaying weapons:

            This class is dumb because they get normal weapons and hidden weapons
        {% elif type == "initiate" %}
            This class is dumb because they get an old-fashioned and modern weapon
        {% elif type == "monstrous" %}
            If you want, you can take one handy weapon:
        {% elif type == "mundane" %}
            You can take two of the following weapons:
        {% elif type == "professional" %}
            This class is dumb because they get a serious weapon and a normal weapon:
        {% elif type == "spell-slinger" %}
            You don't need much - aside from any foci or consumables to power your magic.
            Still, its good to carry some backup. Pick one:
        {% elif type == "spooky" %}
            You can have any magical items or amulets that you use to invoke your powers.
            Additionally, you may take two of the following weapons:
        {% elif type == "wronged" %}
            This class is dumb because they get a 1 signature and 2 practical weapons
